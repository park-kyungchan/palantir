description: Synchronize task list across all terminals
---

Synchronize the native Task List with worker terminal assignments.

## Steps

1. **Read session registry** from `~/.agent/tmp/current_session.json`
   - Get `taskListId` field (set by E1 enhancement)

2. **List all tasks** using `TaskList` tool
   - Show pending, in_progress, and completed tasks

3. **Cross-reference with _progress.yaml**
   - Map tasks to terminal assignments
   - Identify mismatches

4. **Report sync status**

## Output Format

```
## Task Synchronization Report

Session: {sessionId}
Task List ID: {taskListId}

### Native Task List
| ID | Subject | Status | Owner |
|----|---------|--------|-------|
| 1  | ...     | ...    | ...   |

### Worker Assignments (_progress.yaml)
| Terminal | Task | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| B | ... | ... |

### Sync Issues
- (none or list of mismatches)

### Recommendations
- {action to resolve issues}
```

## Notes

- Use this command to verify that all workers are aligned
- Helps identify orphaned or stale tasks
- Run periodically during multi-terminal orchestration
