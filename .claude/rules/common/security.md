# Security Guidelines

## Secret Management

- NEVER hardcode secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens) in source code
- ALWAYS use environment variables or a secret manager
- Validate that required secrets are present at startup
- Rotate any secrets that may have been exposed

## Security Response Protocol

If security issue found:
1. STOP immediately
2. Fix CRITICAL issues before continuing
3. Rotate any exposed secrets
4. Review entire codebase for similar issues
