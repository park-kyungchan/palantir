# Coding Style

## Immutability (CRITICAL)

ALWAYS create new objects, NEVER mutate existing ones:

```
// Pseudocode
WRONG:  modify(original, field, value) → changes original in-place
CORRECT: update(original, field, value) → returns new copy with change
```

Rationale: Immutable data prevents hidden side effects, makes debugging easier, and enables safe concurrency.

## File Organization

MANY SMALL FILES > FEW LARGE FILES:
- High cohesion, low coupling
- 200-400 lines typical, 800 max
- Extract utilities from large modules
- Organize by feature/domain, not by type

## Error Handling

ALWAYS handle errors comprehensively:
- Handle errors explicitly at every level
- Provide user-friendly error messages in UI-facing code
- Log detailed error context on the server side
- Never silently swallow errors

## Input Validation

ALWAYS validate at system boundaries:
- Validate all user input before processing
- Use schema-based validation where available
- Fail fast with clear error messages
- Never trust external data (API responses, user input, file content)

## Size Constraints

- Functions: <50 lines
- Files: <800 lines (800 = hard cap, 400 = target)
