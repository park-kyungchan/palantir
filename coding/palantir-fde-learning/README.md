## 🚀 How to Use

The AI Agent (Gemini 3.0 Pro) has been configured with the **Palantir FDE Learning Protocol**.
Simply ask questions in the chat to start a learning session. The Agent will:

1.  **Read** the relevant Knowledge Base file.
2.  **Synthesize** a 7-component response (Concept, Code, Palantir Context, Philosophy, etc.).
3.  **Guide** you through checking your understanding.

**Example Questions:**
*   "How does Palantir use `SharedArrayBuffer` for high-performance data processing?"
*   "Explain the 'Frontend-in-Backend' build pattern using Gradle."
*   "Walk me through a 'Re-engineering' interview scenario for a buggy React component."
