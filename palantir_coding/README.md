# Educational Ontology Architect

Learn ontology design through cross-language programming: **JS → TS → Python → Ontology**.

## What Is This?

A Constitution-Only Claude Code project. The `.claude/CLAUDE.md` defines ALL behavior —
no pre-built curriculum, no exercises, no static content. Everything is generated
real-time via MCP tools based on your prompts each round.

**Core Principle — "Common Reality":**
An Ontology is a shared definition of reality — a structure so precise that 100 independent
agents would make identical decisions from the same ObjectType definitions.

## How It Works

1. You describe a domain problem (math, logistics, healthcare, anything)
2. The system executes a 3-Step Loop:
   - **Atomic Decomposition** → JS representation (expose limitations)
   - **Context Analysis** → TS interfaces + Python validators (enforce contracts)
   - **Ontology Definition** → ObjectType / LinkType / ActionType (shared reality)
3. Errors trigger a 7-Stage Pipeline with Socratic questioning
4. Schemas evolve as problems grow more complex

## Getting Started

```bash
cd ~/palantir_coding
claude
```

Then describe any domain problem. The system guides you through decomposition,
cross-language implementation, and ontology definition.

## Project Structure

```
.claude/CLAUDE.md       ← The Constitution (defines ALL behavior)
.claude/settings.json   ← Project settings
src/                    ← Empty — grows as you write code
package.json            ← Node/TS runtime
tsconfig.json           ← TypeScript config
```
