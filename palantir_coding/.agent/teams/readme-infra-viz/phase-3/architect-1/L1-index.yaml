architecture_decisions:
  - id: AD-1
    title: Architecture-First section ordering
    rationale: System diagram first, progressive drill-down, glossary last
  - id: AD-2
    title: Collapsible details for agent categories and directory tree
    rationale: 14 agent categories + 78-file tree would overwhelm without collapse
  - id: AD-3
    title: Consistent 4-5 column tables
    rationale: Prevents horizontal scroll on GitHub standard displays
  - id: AD-4
    title: English-primary with Korean parenthetical
    rationale: ASCII monospace requires English labels; Korean in parentheses only
  - id: AD-5
    title: Hero diagram as simplified layer view (~25 lines)
    rationale: Full detail in Section 2; hero shows overview
  - id: AD-6
    title: Pipeline Tiers integrated into Pipeline Flow section
    rationale: Context-adjacent placement over separate concepts section
  - id: AD-7
    title: All 78 files represented with explicit coverage mapping
    rationale: README completeness requirement
