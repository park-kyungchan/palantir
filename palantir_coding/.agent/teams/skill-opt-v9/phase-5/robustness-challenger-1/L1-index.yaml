verdict: "CONDITIONAL_PASS — Plan is fundamentally sound but requires mitigations for 3 HIGH issues (ROB-1/ROB-2: mid-impl recovery; ROB-10: fork-back true cost) and 1 clarification (IFC-4: APPEND vs REPLACE). 3 MEDIUM-HIGH issues addressable during P6 directive construction."

mandatory_mitigations:
  - "ROB-1+ROB-2: Add mid-implementation partial completion recovery protocol — incremental L1 checkpointing, re-spawn for remaining files"
  - "ROB-10: Correct fork-back contingency — document 50-100L body edits needed per skill, not just 2-field removal"
  - "IFC-4: Resolve §Task API APPEND vs REPLACE contradiction"

recommended_mitigations:
  - "ROB-1: Split infra-c into two 4-file implementers"
  - "ROB-12: Add AC for CLAUDE.md §8 safety constraint verification in fork agent .md §Never"
  - "ROB-4: Process execution-coordinator FIRST; add V6b check for review dispatch"
  - "ROB-3: Pre-Phase-A research step for fork error taxonomy"
  - "IFC-9: Add gate criteria for L2 §Downstream Handoff completeness verification"

evidence_count: 11
pt_goal_links:
  - "D-8 (Big Bang): SOUND with gap — mid-impl recovery needed"
  - "D-9 (Fork): SOUND with caveats — error taxonomy gap, fork-back false claim, CLAUDE.md missing"
  - "D-10 (§10 Modification): CLARIFICATION NEEDED — APPEND vs REPLACE"
  - "D-13 (Template B): SOUND with mitigations — execution-coord regression risk"
  - "D-14 (GC Reduction): MINOR gap — scratch concern maintenance, L2 durability"
  - "D-7 (PT-centric): MEDIUM gap — L2 content mapping, version chain with skipped phases"
