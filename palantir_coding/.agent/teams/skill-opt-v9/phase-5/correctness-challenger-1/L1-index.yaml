  - id: CH-01
    type: C-2 (Consistency)
    severity: HIGH
    description: "RISK-8 fallback for permanent-tasks contradicts between section-5-specs (Dynamic Context TaskList inject) and interface-design (full PT via $ARGUMENTS + file output)"

  - id: CH-02
    type: C-1 (Correctness)
    severity: HIGH
    description: "Protocol exception 'TaskCreate/TaskUpdate' slash creates ambiguity about partial Task API access for agents with only TaskCreate blocked"

  - id: CH-03
    type: C-2 (Consistency)
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: "VL count mismatch: plan summary VL-1=6/VL-3=11, per-file specs show VL-1=5/VL-3=12 (total 22 correct, distribution wrong)"

  - id: CH-04
    type: C-2 (Consistency)
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: "Section 10 modification text has 3 versions: implementation plan ('scope:'), section-5-specs ('access is:' + 'Phase Status'), interface-planner L3 ('scope:') — implementer won't know which is authoritative"

  - id: CH-05
    type: C-1 (Correctness)
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: "testing-coordinator current line count wrong: plan gap analysis says 98L, actual file is 117L (19-line discrepancy affects delta estimation)"

  - id: CH-06
    type: C-2 (Consistency)
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: "Template heading inconsistency: '## C) Interface' vs '## C) Interface Section' used interchangeably across plan, V4 checklist, and L3 specs — V4 validation may false-fail"

  - id: CH-07
    type: C-2 (Consistency)
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: "L3 section-5-specs header 'Files #13-#17' actually contains files #13,14,18,19,20 — misleading range could confuse infra-c implementer"

  - id: CH-08
    type: C-1 (Correctness)
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: "impl-b assigned 5 files (exceeds BUG-002 4-file guideline) with 61-75% unique content per skill — 'same template' justification weakened by high uniqueness ratio"

  - id: CH-09
    type: C-1 (Correctness)
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: "infra-c assigned 8 files (2x BUG-002 guideline) — 5 require Template A→B body restructure (non-trivial), only 3 are minor frontmatter changes"

  - id: CH-10
    type: C-2 (Consistency)
    severity: LOW
    description: "Task B processing order violates stated 'smallest to largest' principle: brainstorming (613L) placed before verification (574L)"

  - id: CH-11
    type: C-1 (Correctness)
    severity: LOW
    description: "planning-coordinator line count 2L off: plan says 58L, actual 60L (trivial but signals stale P2 data)"

  - id: CH-12
    type: C-2 (Consistency)
    severity: LOW
    description: "Commit message references C-1~C-5 but plan defines C-1~C-6 (C-6 is 4-way naming, not Interface-Section-specific but still a formal contract)"

verdict: CONDITIONAL_PASS
verdict_rationale: "Plan correctly solves the stated problem. 2 HIGH issues (RISK-8 fallback contradiction, protocol text ambiguity) require resolution before P6. 7 MEDIUM issues should be addressed but are not blocking. 3 LOW issues are cosmetic."
