mandatory_conditions:
  - id: CONS-1
    severity: CRITICAL
    finding: "RISK-8 fallback delta underspecified + two L3 docs contradict on mechanism"
    sources: [CH-01, GAP-01]
    action: "Write exact old→new text for all 8 files; designate interface-planner version as authoritative"

  - id: CONS-10
    severity: HIGH
    finding: "Fork-back is NOT 'always safe' — requires 50-100L body edits per skill (voice, GC removal, inline cross-cutting, error handling), not 2-field frontmatter removal"
    sources: [GAP-04, ROB-10]
    action: "Correct fork-back contingency documentation; specify body changes needed per skill or acknowledge this is a 'small task' not a 'trivial revert'"

  - id: CONS-4
    severity: HIGH
    finding: "§10/protocol text ambiguity — 3 divergent versions, slash ambiguity, APPEND vs REPLACE contradiction"
    sources: [CH-02, CH-04, IFC-4]
    action: "Designate single authoritative text source; rewrite protocol exception clause"

  - id: CONS-2
    severity: HIGH
    finding: "impl-b context budget (5 files, ~3,345L read) + no intra-task checkpointing"
    sources: [CH-08, GAP-02, ROB-2]
    action: "Add L1 checkpoint after each file; prepare split contingency"

  - id: CONS-3
    severity: HIGH
    finding: "infra-c 8-file scope (2x BUG-002) + no mid-implementation recovery protocol"
    sources: [CH-09, GAP-07, ROB-1]
    action: "Add L1 checkpoint every 2-3 files; process execution-coordinator first"

recommended:
  - id: CONS-5
    severity: HIGH
    finding: "Pre-deploy tests fork skills but not coordinator skill behavioral changes"
    sources: [GAP-03, ROB-3]

    severity: MEDIUM-HIGH
    finding: "Execution-coordinator ~45L unique review dispatch at regression risk during Template A→B"
    sources: [ROB-4]

  - id: CONS-16
    severity: MEDIUM-HIGH
    finding: "Fork agents don't have CLAUDE.md loaded — §8 safety constraints must be in agent .md §Never"

  - id: CONS-7
    severity: MEDIUM
    finding: "C-3 contract (GC scratch-only) has no automated verification"
