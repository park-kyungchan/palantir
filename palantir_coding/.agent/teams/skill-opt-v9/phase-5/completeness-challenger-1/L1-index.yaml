gaps:
  - id: GAP-01
    category: C-3
    severity: CRITICAL
    description: "RISK-8 fallback delta (~50L across 8 files) described conceptually, not as implementable text. If Phase A3 triggers, implementers must design during fix-loop."
    section_ref: "§8 RISK-8, §5 RISK-8 Fallback Delta subsections"
    mitigation: "Write exact old->new replacement text for all 8 files before Phase 6"

  - id: GAP-02
    category: C-4
    severity: HIGH
    description: "impl-b context budget: 5 files totaling 2,675L current content + ~670L specs. execution-plan (692L) processed last when context most strained. No intra-task checkpointing."
    section_ref: "§3 Ownership Verification, §4 Task B"
    mitigation: "Split impl-b into 3+2 files, or mandate L1 checkpoint after each file"

  - id: GAP-03
    category: C-3
    severity: HIGH
    description: "Pre-deploy tests fork skills (B->C->D) but NOT coordinator skill changes (GC removal, PT discovery, Interface Section). GC reduction correctness untested until first pipeline run."
    section_ref: "§8 Pre-Deploy Validation Sequence"
    mitigation: "Add Phase E: lightweight coordinator skill functional test"

  - id: GAP-04
    category: C-3
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: "Fork-back contingency removes frontmatter but leaves second-person voice in skill body. Plan claims 'always safe' without addressing voice mismatch for Lead-in-context."
    section_ref: "§10 Fork-Back Contingency"
    mitigation: "Acknowledge voice trade-off explicitly or include body reversion in fork-back procedure"

  - id: GAP-05
    category: C-3
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: "Contract C-3 (GC scratch-only) has no automated verification in Task V. Relies on V6b review quality only. All other contracts have automated checks."
    section_ref: "§7 V6b, §4 Task V"
    mitigation: "Add V6a check: grep for removed GC write patterns across 5 coordinator skills"

  - id: GAP-06
    category: C-3
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: "Fork edge case: PT already [DELIVERED] when /permanent-tasks invoked. pt-manager behavioral spec silent on DELIVERED status handling."
    section_ref: "risk-architect L3 §1.1 pt-manager.md"
    mitigation: "Add to pt-manager.md: check PT subject for [DELIVERED], warn user before modifying"

  - id: GAP-07
    category: C-4
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: "infra-c owns 8 files with no explicit L1/L2 save strategy between files. Compaction at file 6 loses files 7-8 work."
    section_ref: "§3 infra-c:8 files, §4 Task C"
    mitigation: "Add explicit checkpointing instruction: write L1 after every 2-3 files"

  - id: GAP-08
    category: C-3
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: "V6b criteria (voice, cross-cutting, behavioral, interface) defined but not mapped to review agent directives. execution-coordinator may not communicate V6b to spec/code reviewers."
    section_ref: "§7 V6b, §1 Execution Sequence"
    mitigation: "Add V6b criteria to Task description or exec-coordinator directive"

  - id: GAP-09
    category: C-4
    severity: MEDIUM
    description: "Template B transformation for 5 Template A coordinators gives conceptual removal lists but no exact line ranges or surgical diffs."
    section_ref: "§5 Files #13-#20"
    mitigation: "Acceptable if AC-0 (read-first) is enforced. Add explicit instruction to identify boilerplate by content, not line number."

  - id: GAP-10
    category: C-3
    severity: LOW
    description: "Task V Check 8 verifies color present but not color correctness per coordinator assignment."
    section_ref: "§7 V5, §5 Coordinator Gap Analysis table"
    mitigation: "Add expected color values to V5 or Check 8"

  - id: GAP-11
    category: C-4
    severity: LOW
    description: "Theoretical gap between pre-deploy Phase D pass and git add command. Single-session mitigates."
    section_ref: "§9 Staging Command"
    mitigation: "None needed — single-session execution"
