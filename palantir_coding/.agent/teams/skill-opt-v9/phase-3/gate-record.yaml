criteria:
  g3_1_artifacts_exist:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "4 dirs (arch-coord, structure-architect-1, interface-architect-1, risk-architect-1) × L1+L2+L3 verified"
  g3_2_satisfies_scope:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "All 8 scope items from design doc §6 have corresponding designs — 9 skills (2 template variants), 8 coordinators (Template B), 3 fork agents, §10 modification, PT-centric interface, GC 14→3"
  g3_3_research_reflected:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "117 P2 evidence → 149 P3 evidence. All 4 domains reflected: duplication (18.3%→template ~18%), GC migration (14→3 designed), fork feasibility (3 agents designed), coordinator audit (Template B convergence)"
  g3_4_interfaces_defined:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "5 contracts (C-1~C-5) with cardinality, participants, data flow. Template §C format. RISK-8 dependency acknowledged with fallback."
  g3_5_phase4_entry:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "Downstream Handoff: 10 decisions, 5 risks, 6 contracts, 6 constraints, 2 open questions, 4 artifact dirs. Per-skill delta table for task decomposition."
  g3_6_no_unresolved_high_risks:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "4 active HIGH+ risks all have mitigations + fallbacks. RISK-9 eliminated (CLC-1). Phased validation A→D defined."
  g3_7_decisions_documented:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "8 ADRs + 5 contracts + 3 OQs + CLC-1, all with rationale, all PT-traceable via pt_goal_links"

    description: "RISK-8 (task list scope) empirically unverified — Phase 4 should prioritize pre-implementation validation"
  - id: CONCERN-2
    severity: LOW
    description: "OQ-1 (fork spawning, 85%) — if fails, 4→3 fork skills. Pre-deploy validation required."
