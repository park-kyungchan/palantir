  structural:
    - "ADR-S1: 2 skill template variants (coordinator-based + fork-based)"
    - "ADR-S2: Template B convergence for all 8 coordinators"
    - "ADR-S3: memory: project for all coordinators"
    - "ADR-S4: Skills preload DEFERRED (YAGNI)"
    - "ADR-S5: Shared rsil-agent for rsil-global + rsil-review"
    - "ADR-S6: Interface Section (C) NEW for all 9 skills"
    - "ADR-S7: Phase 0 PT Check retained in fork skills"
    - "ADR-S8: Cross-cutting inline for fork (no CLAUDE.md 1-liners)"
  interface:
    - "C-1: PT-centric Read/Write contract (N:1, all skills share one PT)"
    - "C-2: L2 Downstream Handoff chain (replaces 9 GC sections)"
    - "C-3: GC scratch-only (3 concerns: metrics, gate records, version marker)"
    - "C-4: Fork-to-PT Direct (TaskGet/TaskUpdate from fork)"
    - "C-5: §10 exception (3 named fork agents, frontmatter-enforced)"
  risk:
    - "9-item risk register (RISK-1 through RISK-9)"
    - "OQ-1: Fork spawning YES (85% confidence, pre-deploy validation)"
    - "OQ-2: 2 template variants confirmed"
    - "OQ-3: GC elimination in v9.0"
    - "Phased validation: A→B→C→D within Big Bang"
