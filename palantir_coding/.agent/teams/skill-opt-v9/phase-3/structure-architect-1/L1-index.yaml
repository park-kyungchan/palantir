      - 4 fork-based skills classified
      - per-skill unique/shared/new breakdown

decisions:
  - id: ADR-S1
    summary: "2 templates, not 3"
    rationale: "Fork complexity varies in content, not structure"
  - id: ADR-S2
    summary: "Template B convergence, execution-coordinator extended"
    rationale: "45L unique review dispatch logic justified inline"
  - id: ADR-S3
    summary: "memory: project for all 8 coordinators"
    rationale: "Project-scoped learning > user-scoped"
  - id: ADR-S4
    summary: "Skills preload DEFERRED"
    rationale: "Token cost unfavorable; Dynamic Context better"
  - id: ADR-S5
    summary: "Shared rsil-agent for both RSIL skills"
    rationale: "Same tools; skill body differentiates behavior"
  - id: ADR-S6
    summary: "Interface Section (C) NEW for all 9 skills"
    rationale: "D-7 PT-centric interface needs structural home"
  - id: ADR-S7
    summary: "Phase 0 stays in fork skills"
    rationale: "Fork agent needs PT context"
  - id: ADR-S8
    summary: "Cross-Cutting 1-liners for coordinator-based only"
    rationale: "Fork keeps inline (no CLAUDE.md in fork context)"
