tier: COMPLEX
evaluator: Lead
gate_audit: skipped (optional, strong quality)

criteria:
  artifacts_exist:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "4 worker L1/L2 + coordinator consolidated L1/L2, all in phase-2/ directory"
  research_needs_covered:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "4/4 domains complete: duplication (808L), GC mapping (14→3), fork prototype (all FEASIBLE), coordinator audit (25 gaps)"
  sufficient_for_phase3:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "Duplication matrix, GC flow diagram, fork feasibility per skill, coordinator inventory — all Phase 3 inputs ready"
  no_critical_unknowns:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "RISK-1 resolved via CC research: agent: field supports custom .claude/agents/{name}.md. 2 low-risk unknowns remain (fork subagent spawning, task list scope)"
  quality_standard:
    status: PASS
    evidence: "L1: 4 mandatory keys + evidence_count + pt_goal_links. L2: Summary + 4 domain sections + PT Goal Linkage + Evidence Sources + Downstream Handoff"

key_findings:
  - "18.3% extractable duplication (808L of 4,426L), 60-80% unique orchestration per skill"
  - "Task API restriction is frontmatter-enforced, not platform-level — D-10 FEASIBLE"
  - "3 skill families: Pipeline Core (5), Lead-Only (2), RSIL (2) → 2 template variants"
  - "GC reducible from 14 to 3 section types via PT migration + L2 Downstream Handoff"
  - "25 coordinator frontmatter gaps, 175L protocol duplication, Template B convergence target"
  - "RISK-1 RESOLVED: agent: field supports custom .claude/agents/{name}.md (CC research confirmed)"

risks_carried_forward:
  - "RISK-2 (MED-HIGH): permanent-tasks fork loses conversation history"
  - "RISK-3 (MED): delivery-pipeline fork complexity (5+ user gates, git ops)"
  - "RISK-4 (LOW): Skills preload token cost"
  - "2 low-risk unknowns: fork subagent spawning, task list scope in fork"
