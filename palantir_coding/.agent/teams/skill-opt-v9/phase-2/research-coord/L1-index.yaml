cross_domain_synthesis:
  - "Domain 1 ↔ Domain 3: 3 skill families map to 2 template variants (coordinator-based vs fork-based). RSIL skills are hybrid."
  - "Domain 1 ↔ Domain 4: Two-Template Problem in coordinators mirrors duplication in skills — both need shared protocol references"
  - "Domain 2 ↔ Domain 3: Fork skills (rsil-*, permanent-tasks) are exactly the 3 GC non-users — clean migration path"
  - "Domain 3 ↔ Domain 4: Fork agents need new .md files; coordinator .md optimization can serve as template"
