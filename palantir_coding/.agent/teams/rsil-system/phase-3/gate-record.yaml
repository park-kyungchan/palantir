key_outputs:
  - "/rsil-global: G-0→G-4 flow, Three-Tier Observation Window (A/B/C), ~2000 token budget"
  - "/rsil-review: 5 deltas net -10L (561→~551), ultrathink + agent memory + merge + simplify"
  - "Shared Foundation: 8 Lenses + AD-15 + Boundary Test (identical embed, ~85L)"
  - "CLAUDE.md: 5-line NL discipline instruction after §2"
  - "Agent Memory: 4-section schema with seed data from 24 findings"
  - "Cumulative Data Flow: 7×3 trigger matrix, G-{N}/P-R{N} namespacing"

architecture_decisions:
  - "AD-6: Findings-only output (no auto-apply)"
  - "AD-7: Three-Tier per work type (adaptive sources, fixed budget)"
  - "AD-8: BREAK escalation via AskUserQuestion"
  - "AD-9: Tracker section isolation + ID namespacing"
  - "AD-10: Shared Foundation = embedded copy"
  - "AD-11: Single shared agent memory"
