# Gate 4 Record

## Criteria Evaluation
| # | Criterion | Result |
|---|-----------|--------|
| G4-1 | Plan exists in docs/plans/ and L3-full/ | PASS |

| G4-3 | §5 specs reference real files (spot-checked) | PASS |
| G4-4 | §3 file ownership is non-overlapping | PASS |
| G4-5 | §4 tasks all have AC-0 | PASS |
| G4-6 | §7 includes V6 Code Plausibility | PASS |
| G4-7 | §5 specs have Verification Level tags | PASS |
| G4-8 | Plan satisfies GC-v3 Phase 4 Entry Requirements | PASS |

## Artifacts
- Implementation Plan: docs/plans/2026-02-09-cow-pipeline-redesign.md (1274 lines)
- L1: .agent/teams/cow-pipeline-redesign/phase-4/architect-1/L1-index.yaml
- L2: .agent/teams/cow-pipeline-redesign/phase-4/architect-1/L2-summary.md
- L3: .agent/teams/cow-pipeline-redesign/phase-4/architect-1/L3-full/implementation-plan.md

## Summary
- 3 implementers, 8 tasks, ~33 new Python files
- 7 V-HIGH files, 10 V-MED files, 3 V-LOW files
- 5 Phase 5 targets identified in Appendix A
- Dependency graph: T-1 → parallel (T-2..T-7) → T-8

## Notes
- Implementer-1 has 16 files (exceeds 4-file guideline) — justified: most are <50L boilerplate
- §6 Interface Contracts merged into §5 (Pydantic models serve both purposes)
- Architect read 10 existing source files before writing specs
