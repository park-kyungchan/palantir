criteria:
  G2-1: PASS  # L1/L2 artifacts exist (L1 39L, L2 198L)
  G2-2: PASS  # All 3 research domains covered (D1/D2/D3)
  G2-3: PASS  # Sufficient info for Phase 3 (architecture direction adjusted)
  G2-4: PASS  # No unresolved critical unknowns

key_findings:
  - "GC serves 3 roles: phase gating, session discovery, context carrier"
  - "PT substitutable for gating only; context carrier role must persist"
  - "M2 priority downgraded LOW — GC is valid mechanism, not pure overlap"
  - "PT creation at Gate 1 confirmed safe — no downstream changes needed"
  - "Hook modification: NOT needed (PT fallback built in)"
