## Active Teammates
(none — all shut down)

## Phase 2 Results
- Research domains: 3 (D1: GC deps, D2: PT interface, D3: Hook refs)
- Researcher: codebase-researcher (researcher-1), Lead-direct
- Key finding: GC context carrier role must persist; PT creation safe at Gate 1

## Phase 3 Results

- 8 Architecture Decisions (AD-1 through AD-8)
- Line budget: 672L → ~578L (net -94L)
- All 8 issues addressed (H1-H3, M1, L1-L3)
