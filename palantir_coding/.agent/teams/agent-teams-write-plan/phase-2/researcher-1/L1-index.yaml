# L1-index.yaml — agent-teams-write-plan Research Findings
# Phase 2 | researcher-1 | 2026-02-07

status: COMPLETE
domains_analyzed: 3

preserved_principles:
  - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
  - TDD (Test-Driven Development)
  - Frequent commits
  - Exact file paths always
  - Complete code in plan (not "add validation")
  - Exact commands with expected output
  - Bite-sized task granularity (one action per step)
  - Plan saved to docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<feature-name>.md

replaced_elements:
  - TodoWrite → TaskCreate (Lead-only via Task API)
  - Single-engineer target → Multi-teammate pipeline (implementer 1-4)
  - 2-5 min steps → Phase-level tasks with acceptance criteria
  - executing-plans/subagent-driven-dev handoff → Phase 6-8 pipeline
  - git worktree references → shared workspace (.agent/teams/)
  - Plan header "For Claude" → "For Lead" (orchestration target)
  - Execution choice (subagent vs parallel) → pipeline continuation

ch001_universal_sections:
  - §1 Orchestration Overview (parameterize pipeline/teammate count)
  - §2 global-context.md Template
  - §3 File Ownership Assignment
  - §4 TaskCreate Definitions (6-field structure)
  - §7 Validation Checklist (5-category pattern)
  - §8 Commit Strategy
  - §9 Gate Criteria
  - §10 Summary

ch001_specific_sections:
  - §5 Edit Specifications Task A (content-specific, structure universal)
  - §6 Edit Specifications Task B (content-specific, structure universal)
  - §1 "simplified pipeline" instance (P1→6→6.V→9)
  - §1 "single implementer" instance (WHY justification)

new_sections_needed:
  - File Creation Specifications (new files with scaffold/imports)
  - Multi-Implementer Coordination (non-overlapping assignment + dependencies)
  - Test Strategy (Phase 7 entry conditions)
  - Phase 5 Input (verifiable assertions for devils-advocate)
  - External Dependencies / API Contracts

gc_v3_to_v4_delta:
  add:
    - Implementation Plan Reference (docs/plans/ path)
    - Task Decomposition Summary (task count, dependency graph)
    - File Ownership Map (implementer → file set)
    - Phase 6 Entry Conditions (from architect design)
    - Phase 5 Validation Targets (if Phase 5 follows)
    - Commit Strategy (single vs per-task)
  update:
    - Phase Pipeline Status (Phase 4 COMPLETE)
  preserve:
    - Architecture Decisions (from GC-v3)
    - Component Map (from GC-v3)
    - Interface Contracts (from GC-v3)

template_structure:
  - §1 Orchestration Overview (pipeline, teammates, execution sequence)
  - §2 global-context.md Update Template (GC-v3→v4 delta)
  - §3 File Ownership Assignment (per-implementer table)
  - §4 TaskCreate Definitions (per-task 6-field blocks)
  - §5 Change Specifications (per-task: Create/Edit/Delete specs)
  - §6 Test Strategy (Phase 7 entry conditions)
  - §7 Validation Checklist (cross-reference integrity)
  - §8 Commit Strategy (single or per-task)
  - §9 Gate Criteria (Phase 6 gate evaluation)
  - §10 Summary (metadata table)
