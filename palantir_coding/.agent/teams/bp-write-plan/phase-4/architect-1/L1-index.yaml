architecture_decisions:
  - AD-1: P0 → PT existence check only
  - AD-2: Feasibility Check (3-criteria soft gate)
  - AD-3: Checkpoint relocated 1.3.5 → 1.2.5
  - AD-4: Scope + Tier unified at 1.4
  - AD-5: PT creation at Gate 1 via /permanent-tasks
  - AD-6: Sequential-thinking consolidated (9 → 1)
  - AD-7: Git branch cap (head -10)
  - AD-8: RTD DPs reduced (7 → 3)

compression_options:
  - A-hybrid: GC-v1 YAML frontmatter + field list

  - Task_D: Phase 2/3 + Cross-Cutting (S-18 to S-25)
  - Task_E: Verification + Line Count
