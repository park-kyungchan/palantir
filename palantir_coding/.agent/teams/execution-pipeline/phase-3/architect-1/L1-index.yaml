    topic: Clean Termination
    summary: No auto-chain, shutdown sequence, artifact preservation
  - id: AD-8
    topic: SKILL.md Design
    summary: Follows brainstorming-pipeline + agent-teams-write-plan precedent

patterns:
  preserved: 11 (two-stage review, context curation, distrust, ordered review, fix loop, self-review, pre-work QA, stop on blocker, critical plan review, fresh context, final review)
  replaced: 11 (TodoWrite, human checkpoint, ephemeral, sequential, same-session, finish chain, worktree, no DIA, no GC, flat tasks, no ownership)

risks:
  total: 8
  high: 0
  medium: 4 (manipulation, Lead context, cross-boundary, context pressure)
  low: 4 (fix loop exhaust, component merge, final review overhead, plan spec error)
  residual_max: LOW

status: COMPLETE
