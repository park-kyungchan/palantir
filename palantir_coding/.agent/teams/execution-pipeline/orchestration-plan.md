# Orchestration Plan

## Gate History
- Phase 1: APPROVED (2026-02-07)
- Phase 2: APPROVED (2026-02-07) — RC 5/5 PASS, LDAP Q1 STRONG
- Phase 3: APPROVED (2026-02-07) — RC 7/7 PASS, LDAP 4/4 STRONG (MAXIMUM)

## Active Teammates
(none — all shutdown)

## Phase 2 Results
- researcher-1: 3 domains analyzed, L1/L2/L3 written
- claude-code-guide: skill optimization research complete
- Key findings: 11 preserve + 11 replace, Option B delegation, adaptive spawn, Gate 6 2-level

## Phase 3 Results
- architect-1: 8 architecture decisions (AD-1~AD-8), 4 UQ resolved
- Deliverables: architecture-design.md (~610 lines), skill-draft.md (~532 lines)
- Phase 4 skipped: skill-draft.md deployed directly as SKILL.md
- Key decisions: adaptive spawn (connected components), two-stage review (Option B, 58% savings), Gate 6 (per-task + cross-task + 3-layer defense), clean termination

## Phase 9: Delivery
- SKILL.md deployed: .claude/skills/execution-pipeline/SKILL.md
- Design doc: docs/plans/2026-02-07-execution-pipeline-design.md
- Gate records: phase-1~3 gate-record.yaml
- GC-v3: final version

## Teammate Context Versions
- researcher-1: GC-v1 (shutdown)
- architect-1: GC-v2 (shutdown)
