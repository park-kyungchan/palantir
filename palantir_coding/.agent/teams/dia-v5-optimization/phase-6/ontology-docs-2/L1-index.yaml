    description: "Security and governance model — markings, RBAC, proposals, audit, OSDK auth"
    sections:
      - "Marking-based access control (MANDATORY vs CLASSIFICATION, property-level, row-level)"

decisions:
  - "Followed established YAML + prose format from existing Ontology.md and ObjectType_Reference.md"
  - "Both docs exceed 500-line minimum (1222 and 1054 lines respectively)"
  - "Included real code examples for TypeScript, Python, and Java"
  - "Used machine-readable YAML blocks for structured data"
