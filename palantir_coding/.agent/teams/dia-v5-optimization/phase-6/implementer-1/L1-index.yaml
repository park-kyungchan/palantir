    description: Version 4.0 → 5.0 measured language transformation
    changes:
      - Bumped version header to 5.0, updated date to 2026-02-08
      - Removed [PERMANENT] from title and inline text
      - Replaced "ABSOLUTE" with natural phrasing
      - Replaced "FORBIDDEN" with "Blocked" / "never allowed"
      - Replaced "MUST" (ALL CAPS) with "must" (lowercase)
      - Replaced "BEFORE" / "EVERY" / "ALWAYS" (ALL CAPS) with lowercase
      - Replaced "[REQUIRED]" tag with natural instruction
      - Replaced "WHY:" labels with natural explanations
      - Replaced "OWNERSHIP NOTE" with "Ownership"
      - Simplified §1 heading from "Mandatory Pre-Call Protocol" to "Pre-Call Protocol"
      - Simplified §6 heading removed [PERMANENT] tag
      - Converted ALL PASS → "All pass" in verification flow
      - Preserved all tables, code blocks, YAML examples, protocol templates

decisions:
  - Kept [PERMANENT] only at the top-level DIA section header in CLAUDE.md (per instruction)
  - Protocol format strings (e.g., [DIRECTIVE], [IMPACT-ANALYSIS]) left unchanged — these are identifiers, not emphasis
  - Table cell content like "FORBIDDEN" converted to "Blocked" for consistency
  - "Mandatory" → "Required" in MCP tools table for consistency with measured tone

unresolved: []
