completed_changes:
  - "GAP-1: Section 20 Ontology Decomposition Guide added to Ontology.md (8 phases, decision trees, YAML templates)"
  - "GAP-2: Section 10 Object/Property Security Policies added to Security_and_Governance.md (from tavily research)"
  - "GAP-2 ENHANCED: Added 8 comparison types (Equal/Intersects/Subset/Superset/LT/GT/LTE/GTE), user attribute types, weight formula (collection=1000, total<10000)"
  - "GAP-3: Ontology Manager UI Metadata subsection added to Section 1 of Ontology.md"
  - "GAP-3 ENHANCED: Replaced generic render hints with official 8 types + dependency chain (Searchable→Selectable/Sortable/Low cardinality)"
