# Orchestration Plan

## Gate History
- Phase 1: APPROVED (2026-02-08)
- Phase 2: APPROVED (2026-02-08)
- Phase 3: APPROVED (2026-02-08)

## Active Teammates
(none — all shutdown after Gate 3)

## Phase 2 Summary
- researcher-1: Opus 4.6 + CC v2.1.37 (7 HIGH, 4 MED opportunities) — auto-compacted but L1/L2/L3 saved
- researcher-2: INFRA patterns (6 HIGH, 3 MED improvements + Phase 9 requirements)

## Phase 3 Summary
- architect-1: 8 ADs, 3 probing questions defended, multi-session discovery refinement
- RSIL scope EXPANDED by user: push to marginal line of Layer 1 capabilities

## Phase 4 Plan
- Use /agent-teams-write-plan
- Architect must re-evaluate ALL RSIL items for feasibility via claude-code-guide
- Input: GC-v3 + Phase 3 architecture design
- RSIL boundary rule: implement all that's technically feasible in Opus 4.6 + CC v2.1.37
