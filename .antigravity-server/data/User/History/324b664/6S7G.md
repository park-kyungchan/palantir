# Implementation: Jan 2026 Pilot Results (ActionTable_2504.pdf)

Following the pivot to Vision-Native de-rendering, a pilot was conducted on the first page of `ActionTable_2504.pdf` to validate the new strategy.

## 1. Pilot Objectives
- Validate image conversion quality.
- Verify de-rendering engine's ability to recover tables that `Docling` missed.
- Confirm structural integrity via Pydantic schema validation.

## 2. Evidence of Success

### 2.1 Table Recovery
- **Source**: Page 1 of `ActionTable_2504.pdf` contains a legend table for Action IDs and ParameterSet IDs.
- **Previous Attempt (Docling)**: 0 tables found. Content merged into garbled text blocks.
- **Vision-Native Result**: Successfully identified a 4x2 table.
- **Data Integrity**: Accurate preservation of Symbol vs. Description columns.

### 2.2 Structural Validation
The generated JSON (`page_1.json`) was passed through `scripts/validate_real_twin.py`:
```text
Loading Twin from temp_vision/page_1.json...
✅ Pydantic Validation Successful!
Document ID: doc_2504_action_table
Page 1 Loaded with 7 blocks.
--- Block Verification ---
[TEXT] ID: p1_b1 (Caption)
[HEADER] ID: p1_b2 (Title)
[TEXT] ID: p1_b3 (Body)
[TABLE] ID: p1_b5 (4 Rows, 2 Columns)
[IMAGE] ID: p1_logo (Hancom Logo)
```

## 3. Comparison Metrics

| Metric | Docling Pipeline | Vision-Native Pipeline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Table Detection** | 0% | 100% (on pilot page) |
| **OCR Accuracy** | Low (Garbled Korean) | High (Preserved nuances) |
| **Layout Fidelity** | Poor (Single Column) | High (Multi-element awareness) |
| **Validation** | Manual/Eyeball | Automated (Pydantic) |

## 4. Conclusion
The pilot confirms that Vision-Native de-rendering is the viable path forward for high-fidelity HWPX reconstruction when source documents contain dense tabular data or complex visual structures.
