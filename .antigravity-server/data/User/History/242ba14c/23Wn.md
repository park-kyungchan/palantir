# Deep Audit: PDF Parsing Pipeline

## Goal
Audit the PDF parsing and ingestion pipeline (PDF -> IR) and prepare the context for further work, excluding the HWPX conversion stage.

## User Review Required
- Confirmation of the "PDF Parsing Pipeline" boundaries (presumed to be Ingestors/Vision -> IR Models).

## Proposed Changes
No code changes are proposed in this audit phase. The goal is analysis and verification.

### Audit Scope
- **Ingestors**: `lib/ingestors/*`
- **Models**: `lib/models.py` (IR definitions)
- **Prompts**: `prompts/vision_derender.md`
- **Controllers**: Any logic coordinating the ingestion.

## Verification Plan
### Automated Tests
- Run `audit_protocol.py` (if executable).
- Manual verification of import chains and signatures.
