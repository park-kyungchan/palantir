# Governance: Local Performance Constraints
Last Updated: January 2026

To ensure system stability, all automated operations on the local workstation must adhere to the following hardware-informed policy.

## Hardware Profile (kc-palantir)
- **Processor**: Intel(R) Core(TM) Ultra 7 155H (3.80 GHz)
- **RAM**: 16.0 GB (15.6 GB usable)
- **Architecture**: 64-bit x64
- **Environment**: WSL2 (Ubuntu) connected to Windows 11 Host

## Performance Policy: "Split-Work Execution"
The user has mandated a strict "Divide and Conquer" approach for processing to avoid resource overloads and application crashes (particularly Hancom Office 2024, which can be resource-intensive during OLE automation).

### 1. Granular Processing
- **Directive**: Do NOT process large document batches in a single monolithic execution.
- **Implementation**: Split large PDF/HWPX files into smaller segments or process them section-by-section.
- **Resource Flush**: Ensure temporary file handles and HWP instances are closed between major segments.

### 2. Dependency Management
- **Inference Engines**: Tools like `Docling` (DocLayout-YOLO) and `Surya-OCR` utilize the CPU/GPU for inference.
- **Throttling**: Monitor RAM usage. If memory pressure exceeds 80% (approx 12.8GB), pause or serialise tasks that would otherwise run in parallel.

### 3. Bridge Latency
- The WSL2-to-Windows PowerShell bridge introduces minimal overhead, but the **Executor** (Windows-side) should be monitored for hanging HWP processes.
- Always use `wait=True` in `WSLBridge.run_python_script` for sequential reliability unless background processing is explicitly required and safety-checked.
