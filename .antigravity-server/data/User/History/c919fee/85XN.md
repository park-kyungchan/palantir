# HWPX Reconstruction Pipeline: Project Purpose

The **HWPX Reconstruction Pipeline** is a specialized automation framework designed to solve the challenge of high-fidelity document conversion into the Hancom Office (HWPX) format. 

## Core Problem
Standard document converters often fail to maintain the complex structural integrity of Hancom Office documents (e.g., specific table behaviors, multi-column newspaper layouts, and OLE-based form elements). This project bridges the gap by using native automation to "reconstruct" documents in the actual application.

## Key Features
- **High-Fidelity Reconstruction**: Instead of simple file-format conversion, the system "types" and "builds" the document using Hancom's internal action models.
- **Multi-Engine Ingestion**: Support for `Docling` (layout analysis), `Surya` (fast OCR), and `PyMuPDF` (text extraction).
- **Hancom Office 2024 Support**: Optimized for the latest version of the office suite, including OOXML-compliant HWPX structures.
- **Automated Security Bypass**: Implements techniques to suppress HWP's internal security dialogs for unattended execution.

## Use Cases
- Converting legacy PDFs to editable HWPX files.
- Re-verifying and repairing corrupted HWPX structures.
- Automated document generation from standardized JSON payloads.
