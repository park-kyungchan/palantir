## KS X 6101:2024 community/non-official sources (collected)

Intent: Provide non-official, community-visible evidence for KS X 6101:2024
without relying on official homepage sources.

### Community developer documentation (GitHub)

Source: OpenHWP (community project)
- Repo: https://github.com/openhwp/openhwp
- Docs root: https://github.com/openhwp/openhwp/tree/main/docs/hwpx

Evidence (2024 namespace + explicit citation):
- File: docs/hwpx/05-relations.md
  - Mentions 2024 namespaces, e.g.:
    - http://www.owpml.org/owpml/2024/head
    - http://www.owpml.org/owpml/2024/body
    - http://www.owpml.org/owpml/2024/paragraph
- File: docs/hwpx/09-header-schema.md
  - "출처: KS X 6101:2024, 페이지 26-41"
- File: docs/hwpx/10-body-schema.md
  - "출처: KS X 6101:2024, 페이지 92-111"
- File: docs/hwpx/appendix-explanation.md
  - "KS X 6101:2024 해설"

Notes:
- These docs are not official, but explicitly refer to KS X 6101:2024.
- The 2024 namespace URIs are distinct from the 2011/2016 Hancom URIs.

### Non-official standard catalog listings

Source: Antpedia (standard catalog)
- URL: https://www.antpedia.com/standard/1518050584.html
- Evidence:
  - Page title and metadata list "KS X 6101-2024"
  - Describes "Open Word Processor Markup Language (OWPML) document structure"

Source: National Digital Standards Library (NDLS China)
- URL: https://ndls.org.cn/standard/detail/ab1e1c0b9c48bd9ee60cf63e966f564c
- Evidence:
  - Lists "KS X 6101-2024"
  - Includes date "2024-10-30"
  - Includes Korean title string for the standard name

### Local doc status (not authoritative)

Local references in this repo:
- docs/hwpx_progrmmatic.md
  - Claims "latest revision 2024-10-30" but no cited source.
- docs/ks-x-6101-owpml.md
  - States KS X 6101:2018 and does not confirm 2024 revision.

Conclusion:
- Community docs and non-official catalogs provide evidence that a 2024
  revision exists, but they are not authoritative. Treat as corroboration,
  not proof. For compliance, align namespace usage to 2024 only when the
  target reader explicitly supports it.
