criteria:
  G3-1: PASS  # L1/L2/L3 artifacts exist and complete
  G3-2: PASS  # Architecture satisfies Scope Statement (SKL-006 + RSIL + Layer 2 compat)
  G3-3: PASS  # Phase 2 research findings reflected (R-1 and R-2 both incorporated)
  G3-4: PASS  # Component interfaces defined (§8: input, output, PT, cleanup)
  G3-5: PASS  # Phase 4 entry requirements specified (§10)
  G3-6: PASS  # No unresolved HIGH+ risks (6 risks, all mitigated)
  G3-7: PASS  # 8 ADs documented with rationale and alternatives

architecture_decisions:
  AD-1: "3 sub-phases: Consolidation → Delivery → Cleanup"
  AD-2: "User-confirmed git, never auto-commit"
  AD-3: "ARCHIVE.md in session directory"
  AD-4: "PT→MEMORY via Read-Merge-Write"
  AD-5: "Preserve artifacts, clean transients"
  AD-6: "RSIL scope EXPANDED: push to marginal line of Opus 4.6 + CC v2.1.37 capabilities"
  AD-7: "No skill DRY extraction this sprint (unless feasibility re-eval changes this)"
  AD-8: "Support both GC and PT input discovery (multi-session default)"

probing_questions:
  Q1_ordering: "ACCEPTED — post-rejection recovery step added"
  Q2_multi_session: "ACCEPTED — L3 updated with cross-session discovery as default"
  Q3_consolidation_first: "ACCEPTED — commit message quality, minimal compact risk, single clean commit"

user_decisions:
  archive_location: "session directory (.agent/teams/{session-id}/ARCHIVE.md)"
  rsil_scope: "EXPANDED — push to marginal line of Layer 1 capabilities, defer only Layer 2 items"
  pr_behavior: "always offer"
  discovery: "cross-session (multi-session as default)"

notes:
  - "User expanded RSIL scope from architect's conservative 5 items to full Layer 1 capability boundary"
  - "Phase 4 must re-evaluate ALL deferred RSIL items for feasibility via claude-code-guide"
  - "Layer 2 (Ontology/Foundry) will cover anything beyond Layer 1 limits"
