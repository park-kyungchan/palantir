result: APPROVED

trigger: "PERMANENT Task design (docs/plans/2026-02-08-permanent-tasks-design.md) — user mandated absolute reflection"
architect: architect-2

criteria:
  G3-1: PASS  # L1/L2/L3 artifacts exist — L1 (124 lines), L2 (97 lines), L3 (1326 lines)
  G3-2: PASS  # Architecture satisfies Phase 1 Scope Statement (NLP conversion + PT integration)
  G3-3: PASS  # Phase 2 research findings reflected (13/13 findings from researcher-1)
  G3-4: PASS  # Component interfaces clearly defined (CLAUDE.md ↔ common-protocol ↔ agent .md ↔ PERMANENT Task)
  G3-5: PASS  # Phase 4 entry requirements specified (12-task breakdown with dependency graph)
  G3-6: PASS  # No unresolved HIGH+ risks (9 risks, all mitigated — 4 new PT-specific risks added)
  G3-7: PASS  # Decisions documented (AD-1 through AD-9 with rationale)

ldap_challenge:
  intensity: STANDARD (1Q — revision scope, not full architecture)
  q1_scope_boundary: PASS — correctly distinguished 10-file PT scope from 8-file NLP scope

permanent_task_integration:
  migration_items_mapped: 10/10  # All M-1~M-10 from permanent-tasks-design mapped to tasks
  agent_md_tasks_added: 2  # T11/T12 from original L3 scope (6 agent .md files)
  total_tasks: 12  # 10 from PT design + 2 from original L3
