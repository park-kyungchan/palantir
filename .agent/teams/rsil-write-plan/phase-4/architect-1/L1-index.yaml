plan_structure:
  §1: Orchestration Overview (pipeline, teammates, execution sequence)
  §2: Architecture Summary (component map, interface contracts, decisions)
  §3: File Ownership Assignment (2 implementers, zero overlap)
  §4: Task Decomposition (4 tasks: A, B, C, D with AC-0)
  §5: Detailed File Specifications (A1-A15, B1-B7, C1-C4)
  §6: Integration Points (5 cross-file verification steps)
  §7: Validation Checklist (V1-V6 including Code Plausibility)
  §8: Risk Register (R-1~R-7 carried + R-8~R-12 new)
  §9: Commit Strategy (single recommended, 2-commit alternative)
  §10: Phase 5 Validation Targets (7 challenges, 5 assumptions)

implementation_split:
  implementer-1:
    files: [".claude/skills/rsil-global/SKILL.md (NEW, ~400-500L)"]
    tasks: [A]
    vl: "VL-2/VL-3 (guided generation with creative sections)"
  implementer-2:
    files:
      - ".claude/skills/rsil-review/SKILL.md (MODIFY, 5 deltas)"
      - ".claude/CLAUDE.md (MODIFY, +5L)"
      - "~/.claude/agent-memory/rsil/MEMORY.md (NEW, ~86L)"
      - "docs/plans/2026-02-08-narrow-rsil-tracker.md (MODIFY, +section)"
    tasks: [B, C]
    vl: "VL-1 (exact copy / precise specs)"

verification_levels:
  VL-1_specs: [A1, A3, A12, A13, A14, B1-B7, C1-C4]
  VL-2_specs: [A2, A5, A6, A8, A9, A10, A15, C4]
  VL-3_specs: [A7]

key_decisions:
  - head -50 (not head -30) for agent memory dynamic context — §7 authoritative
  - Verbatim Foundation text in §5 — not reference to rsil-review lines
  - Interface consistency by construction — single §5 document
  - 7 V6 Code Plausibility items flagged for runtime verification
