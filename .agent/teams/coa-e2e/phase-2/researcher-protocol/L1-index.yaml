decisions:
  - id: D-R1
    decision: "COA-2 is the foundational signal; all other COAs consume or are triggered by it"
    rationale: "Single signal source prevents protocol fragmentation"
  - id: D-R2
    decision: "COA-5 is a check type within COA-4, not a standalone protocol"
    rationale: "MCP verification is one dimension of mid-execution verification"
  - id: D-R3
    decision: "3 new format strings: [SELF-LOCATE], [REVERIFY], [REVERIFY-RESPONSE]"
    rationale: "Minimal additions to §4 Communication Protocol"
