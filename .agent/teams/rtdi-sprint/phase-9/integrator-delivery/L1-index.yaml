tasks:
  task_1_cross_reference_verification:
    status: PASS
    details: |
      All 10 files in Ontology-Definition/docs/ verified.
      Files 7/8/9 have explicit Cross-Document Reference Maps.
      Files 1-6 have no broken outbound references (they predate the cross-ref convention).
      ontology_8 → ontology_9: RESOLVED (line 15, 968)
      ontology_9 → ontology_1..8: All 8 references valid (lines 40-42, 751-758, 775-782)
      ontology_7 → ontology_1..6,8: All 7 references valid (lines 1358-1364)
      ontology_8 → ontology_1,2,3,5,6,7,9: All 7 references valid (lines 962-968)
      gap-analysis.md → ontology_1..9: All 9 references valid (lines 233-241, 382-390)
      No orphaned references found.

  task_2_format_consistency:
    status: PASS_WITH_NOTE
    details: |
      Files 3,4,7: Full YAML spec (official_definition, semantic_definition, structural_schema, integration_points) - COMPLIANT
      Files 1,2: Older format with official_definition/semantic_definition/structural_schema at subsection level - COMPLIANT (pre-enrichment format)
      Files 8: Uses section-level headers (## official_definition, ## structural_schema) + cross_references - COMPLIANT
      Files 9: Uses component-level YAML (official_definition, semantic_definition inside YAML blocks) - COMPLIANT
      Files 5,6: Narrative+heading format (Official Definition, Semantic Definition as markdown) without YAML-fenced spec blocks - DIVERGENT from other files
      NOTE: Files 5,6 were not enriched in the same batch format. This is cosmetic, not functional. Content coverage is complete.

  task_3_palantir_docs_assessment:
    status: ALREADY_DELETED
    recommendation: NO_ACTION_NEEDED
    details: |
      park-kyungchan/palantir/docs/*.md files are ALREADY showing as deleted in git status.
      The 4 source docs (Ontology.md, Security_and_Governance.md, OSDK_Reference.md, ObjectType_Reference.md)
      plus Education Domain Ontology PDF are already staged for deletion.
      Ontology-Definition/docs/ is the sole authoritative source (RTDI-010).
      No dual-source inconsistency risk.

  task_4_infra_verification:
    status: PASS
    details: |
      CLAUDE.md: "Version: 5.0 (DIA v5.0)" confirmed (line 3)
      Pre-Spawn Checklist: Gates S-1, S-2, S-3 present (lines 138-157)
      No `mode: "plan"` in any agent .md files
      All 6 agents use permissionMode: default (4) or acceptEdits (2) — correct per BUG-001 workaround
      No "plan" mode anywhere in .claude/agents/
