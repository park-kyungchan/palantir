    file: L3-full/domain-2-implementer-agent-analysis.md
    summary: "implementer tools, DIA TIER 1, File Ownership, Sub-Orchestrator, adaptive spawn"
    key_output: "Adaptive spawn algorithm based on plan §3/§4 independent clusters"
    dia_tier: 1
    ldap_intensity: HIGH
    max_instances: 4

  domain_3_code_reviewer:
    file: L3-full/domain-3-code-reviewer-integration.md
    summary: "code-reviewer as ephemeral subagent in Gate 6, Option B (implementer delegated)"
    key_output: "Two-stage review via implementer Sub-Orchestrator + Lead cross-verify"
    recommended_option: "B (Delegated to Implementer)"

recommendations:
  - "Two-stage review → implementer Sub-Orchestrator pattern"
  - "Adaptive spawn = independent file clusters (max 4)"
  - "Gate 6 = per-task + cross-task two-level evaluation"
  - "Reviewers remain ephemeral (DIA exempt)"
  - "Fix loop capped at 3 iterations per stage"
  - "Final whole-project review preserved (optional)"
  - "GC-v4→v5 delta reflects Phase 6 results"
  - "Clean Termination (no auto-chain)"
