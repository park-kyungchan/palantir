Review the updated planning document for V2.1.19 Feature Integration - Iteration 3.

**Planning Document Location:** /home/palantir/.agent/plans/v2.1.19-feature-integration-20260125.yaml

**Context:** This is Iteration 3 of the Plan Agent review. 

Iteration 2 found:
- [MAJOR] Phase 3/4 file conflict on research/SKILL.md → FIXED: Added Phase 3 dependency to Phase 4
- [MINOR] Incomplete usageMatrix → Noted for Phase 5 documentation task

**Changes Made (v1.2.0):**
1. Phase 4 now depends on Phase 3 (in addition to Phase 2)
2. Updated parallelization strategy diagram to show sequential Phase 3 → Phase 4
3. Updated critical path to ~120 minutes
4. Updated dependency graph with new Phase 3 → Phase 4 relationship

**Review Criteria:**
1. All phases have clear completion criteria
2. Dependencies form acyclic graph (no circular dependencies)  
3. Target files have NO OVERLAP between phases that run in parallel
4. Risk mitigation strategies identified
5. Parallelization opportunities properly identified

**Your Task:**
1. Read the planning document
2. Verify the Phase 3/4 conflict is resolved
3. Verify the dependency graph is acyclic
4. Check for any remaining issues
