      Rated highest (★) in printed media OCR alongside Gemini 2.5 Pro and Google Vision.
      Lower tolerance to scan imperfections compared to specialized OCR tools.

    multilingual: |
      Strong multilingual support:
      - Confirmed support for English and Spanish
      - Claude 3.7 supports extensive language coverage
      - Better suited for multilingual documents than earlier models
      - Successfully tested with Korean/English mixed content

      Note: For multilingual invoice processing specifically, GPT was rated slightly
      higher, followed by Claude, but Claude excels in general multilingual document analysis.

  # Overall Recommendations for Content Understanding
  recommendation_for_content: |
    Claude Opus 4.5 is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for mathematical and scientific content understanding:

    PRIMARY STRENGTHS:
    1. Mathematical Content: Excellent LaTeX generation, formal proof writing, equation recognition
    2. Visual Reasoning: Best-in-class chart/graph interpretation with contextual understanding
    3. Scientific Diagrams: Teaching-level explanations of complex technical diagrams
    4. Text Extraction: 97% accuracy on clean PDFs, strong multilingual support
